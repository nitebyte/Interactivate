**Version 1.0 | © 2025 Nightbyte Ltd. (Colorado, USA)**

## Preamble  
Nightbyte Ltd. ("Nightbyte," "we," or "us") hereby provides this license (the "License") governing your utilization, manipulation, dissemination, and interpretation ("use") of the original works of code, scripting, data articulation, and other digital constructs (the "Works") authored or provided by Nightbyte Ltd. This License applies to the Works presented within this repository, hosted at <https://github.com/nitebyte>, or any other duly authorized public venue.

By using this repository, you automatically commit yourself to the terms herein outlined. Reading or even slight perusal constitutes immediate binding consent. Should this seem unreasonable, you are advised henceforth to avert your gaze promptly.

## 1. Usage and Scope-of-Allowed Operations  
Nightbyte Ltd. generously grants you the non-exclusive, irrevocable, unrestricted (yet inexplicably conditional) privilege to copy, modify, redistribute, display, compile, decompile, twist, turn, merge, and in any other civilized fashion tinker with the Works, provided always that the full and entire text of this License remains attached or accompanied in all substantive redistributions.

## 2. Attribution  
You must unambiguously attribute Nightbyte Ltd. in any Works and derived applications as the originator of any code clearly and demonstrably originating herein. A modest nod, passing acknowledgment, or tastefully sized footnote praising the ingenuity, however minimal, of Nightbyte Ltd. shall suffice.

## 3. Conditions of Restrictions  
You expressly agree not to use the Nightbyte Works:  
- To cause, whether deliberately or inadvertently, the sudden extinction of any flora or fauna species.  
- To operate, manage, or significantly influence the market value of obscure collectibles, figurines, or vintage teaware.  
- In connection with any organized sport involving overly intricate rules or arcane points systems impossible to explain concisely to guests unfamiliar with the game.  

Further to the above, it is absolutely and irrevocably prohibited that you claim authorship or creative ownership of the Works, as Nightbyte Ltd. has demonstrated, through appropriate mental effort and considerable coffee consumption, the original authorship thereof.

## 4. Liability and Responsibility
Nightbyte Ltd., not intending upon inducing myocardial infarction among its legal representatives, expressly clarifies: all Works are provided "as-is," entirely without warranty or reassurance. Nightbyte Ltd. notably disclaims any implied, expressed or whispered warranties of merchantability, suitability for purpose or non-infringement. Users are reasonably expected to exercise common sense; failing its presence, the nearest available common sense proxy.

Nightbyte Ltd. disclaims all responsibility, direct, indirect, or ambiguous, for any inevitable, accidental, improbable, or wildly irrelevant damages, difficulties, technical bewilderment, software exasperation, corporate embarrassment, or existential introspection triggered by exposure to these Works, including but certainly not limited to loss of data, profits, or office stationery.

## 5. Indemnification (or the Polite Demand to Sort Out Your Own Affairs)  
You are unequivocally responsible for all consequences of your interactions with these Works. Should your innovative misuse of Nightbyte Ltd.'s Works inadvertently summon legal turmoil, unpleasant audits, spirited discourse, or similarly disagreeable proceedings, you shall remain solely accountable. Likewise, Nightbyte Ltd. shall remain at a comfortable distance from your affairs, lightly amused yet utterly blameless.

## 6. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
This License shall be governed exclusively by the laws of Colorado, USA, notwithstanding Nightbyte Ltd.'s appreciation for English jurisprudence and polite, indirect resolutions over tea. Should any uncomfortable dispute arise and parties find themselves utterly incapable of mature negotiation, jurisdiction and venue shall be provided by appropriate legal authorities strategically located within the State of Colorado, USA.

## 7. Severability and Continuity Clause
If any paragraph, clause or vaguely parenthetical statement of this License is ever conclusively proven unenforceable or nonsensical by an authoritative judiciary body (despite our carefully sterilized grammar and punctuation), the balance of this License shall remain merrily robust and operational to the maximum extent possible, with mildly amused curiosity as to which portion we’ve managed to botch.

## 8. Modification and Updates of License  
This License may be updated at the discretion and whim of Nightbyte Ltd. Revisions will be appropriately communicated, assuming the continued existence of electronic communication methods, courteous discourse, and civilization as we recognize it.
